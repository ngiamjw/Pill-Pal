## Inspiration  
The idea for Pill Pal was inspired by my grandparents, who often forgot to take their medication, making it difficult for my parents to track their health. With Singaporeâ€™s aging population in mind, I wanted to create a solution that simplifies medication tracking and supports caregivers in ensuring their loved ones stay on top of their prescriptions.  

## ðŸ› Development  
Pill Pal was developed as part of a **team of three**, where I led the project by:

- Developing **backend functions** to reset the database daily.  
- Overseeing **UI design** to ensure accessibility for elderly users.  
- Managing **task delegation** to optimize development efficiency.
